# CS-255 Portfolio: System Analysis and Design

This repository contains key artifacts from my work in CS-255, showcasing my ability to gather business requirements and design systems that meet client needs.

The DriverPass project was a consulting engagement with a client who needed a system to streamline the driverâ€™s education experience. The system was designed to allow students to register for courses, schedule practice sessions, and take mock exams, while instructors could manage student progress and availability.

I translated client interviews into a clear business requirements document and a modular system design. These documents reflect my strengths in organizing stakeholder input, modeling system behavior, and planning scalable solutions.

One area I would improve is the use case diagrams. Adding more detailed actor interactions and edge cases would enhance clarity and better reflect real-world usage.

User needs were central to my design process. I prioritized usability and intuitive workflows to ensure both students and instructors could navigate the system easily. Considering user needs is essential to building systems that are functional, efficient, and adopted by their intended audience.

My approach to software design is rooted in systems thinking. I begin with stakeholder interviews, then move into requirement gathering, UML modeling, and iterative refinement. In future projects, Iâ€™ll continue using techniques like Gantt chart planning, dependency mapping, and reusable templates to ensure clarity and maintainability.
